# Mountain Sim Ideas

# features 

This is a list of features I want to have in my mountain simulator

### fBm

implement fBm to make more realistic mountain features
i want the mountain ranges to look real

### texture blending
change from colors to textures like grass, snow, sand. Allow for tinting of the textures.Â 
use noise to generate trees and maybe rocks or other features. Allow for density, height/gradient restrictions
for example if the feature is ver tall or steep, no trees should spawn

### game menu and UI
make in game menu to control parameters
make a simple yet good looking UI for users

# optimizations

### simplex noise
only implement if more performance is needed

### lod/mesh decimation
only implement as a last ditch effort (might be tougher)
